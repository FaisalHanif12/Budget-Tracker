## Features

### User Authentication

- **Secure Login**: Offers a dual authentication mechanism, allowing users to sign in using their email or through Google, ensuring a secure access gateway to their financial data.

![signup](doc/features/signin.jpg)
 
```javascript
function SignIn() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  const [showPassword, setShowPassword] = useState(false);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState({ email: '', password: '' });

  const validateForm = () => {
    let formIsValid = true;
    let errors = {};

    // Example validation logic
    if (!email) {
      errors.email = 'Email is required';
      formIsValid = false;
    } else if (!/\S+@\S+\.\S+/.test(email)) {
      errors.email = 'Email is invalid';
      formIsValid = false;
    }

    if (!password) {
      errors.password = 'Password is required';
      formIsValid = false;
    } else if (password.length < 6) {
      errors.password = 'Password must be at least 6 characters';
      formIsValid = false;
    }

    setError(errors);
    return formIsValid;
  }
```

### Dashboard Overview

- **Financial Summary**: Presents a dynamic dashboard that aggregates total incomes and expenses, offering a quick snapshot of the user's current financial standing.
- **Trend Visualization**: Incorporates graphical representations to depict financial trends over time, facilitating an intuitive understanding of income and expense patterns.

![dashboard](doc/features/dashboard.jpg)
![dashboard](doc/features/dashboard_01.jpg)
![dashboard](doc/features/dashboard_02.jpg)
  
```javascript
function Dashboard({ totalIncomes, totalExpenses }) {
  // Calculate the total financial data
  const total = totalIncomes + totalExpenses;

  // Function to reload the page
  const handleReload = () => {
    window.location.reload();
  };
```

### Income and Expense Management

- **CRUD Operations**: Users can effortlessly add, modify, and delete income and expense records, enabling precise financial tracking.
- **Categorization**: Each income and expense entry can be categorized, allowing for organized financial management and easier analysis.
- **Date and Amount Tracking**: Records include essential details such as amount, date, and a brief description, ensuring comprehensive financial documentation.

![incomes](doc/features/incomes.jpg)

```javascript
function Incomes() {
  const [incomes, setIncomes] = useState(() => {
    const savedIncomes = localStorage.getItem('incomes');
    return savedIncomes ? JSON.parse(savedIncomes) : [];
  });
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const [amount, setAmount] = useState('');
  const [date, setDate] = useState('');
  const [description, setDescription] = useState('');
  const [isPaid, setIsPaid] = useState(false);
  const [editing, setEditing] = useState(false);
  const [currentIncome, setCurrentIncome] = useState(null);
  const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(1);
  const [incomesPerPage] = useState(5);
  const [category, setCategory] = useState('');
  const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState('');

  const categories = ['Salary', 'Freelance', 'Investment', 'Other'];

  useEffect(() => {
    localStorage.setItem('incomes', JSON.stringify(incomes));
  }, [incomes]);
```

### Data Persistence and Security

- **Local Storage Utilization**: Utilizes the browser's localStorage to securely store financial data on the user's device, ensuring data persistence between sessions without compromising privacy.
- **Data Backup and Recovery**: Encourages users to export their data periodically as a backup measure, safeguarding against data loss.
```javascript
    const savedIncomes = localStorage.getItem('incomes');
```

### Data Visualization

- **Interactive Charts**: Leverages Chart.js to render interactive and customizable charts, offering users a visual analysis tool to monitor financial growth or detect concerning trends.

![data](doc/features/graph.jpg)

```javascript
  const chartOptions = {
    scales: {
      x: {
        type: 'time',
        time: {
          unit: 'day',
        },
        title: {
          display: true,
          text: 'Date',
        },
      },
      y: {
        title: {
          display: true,
          text: 'Income (â‚¬)',
        },
      },
    },
  };
    <Col md={6}>
    <div className="chart-container">
      <Line data={chartData} options={chartOptions} />
    </div>
  </Col>
```

### Export Functionality

- **Excel Export**: Enables users to export their financial data to Excel format, providing the flexibility to perform detailed analyses or maintain records outside the application.

![excel](doc/features/excel.jpg)
 
```javascript
  const exportToExcel = () => {
    const ws = XLSX.utils.json_to_sheet(incomes);
    const wb = XLSX.utils.book_new();
    XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(wb, ws, "Incomes");
    XLSX.writeFile(wb, "Incomes.xlsx");
  };
```

### Search and Filter

- **Efficient Searching**: Incorporates a search functionality that allows users to quickly find specific income or expense entries based on keywords, enhancing the user experience by saving time and effort.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Users can filter their financial records by categories, dates, or amounts, facilitating targeted analysis and helping identify areas for financial improvement.

![search](doc/features/search.jpg)
  
```javascript
  const filteredIncomes = searchQuery.length > 0
    ? incomes.filter(income =>
        income.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
        income.description.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
        (income.category?.toLowerCase() || '').includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase())
      )
    : incomes;
```

## Framer Motion

Enhanced User Experience with Motion: Leverages Framer Motion, a powerful animation library for React, to create smooth, engaging animations and transitions. This enhances the user interface by providing visual feedback, subtle animations on page transitions, button interactions, and dynamic chart movements, contributing to a more interactive and polished user experience.

### Responsive Design

- **Cross-Device Compatibility**: Designed with a responsive layout to ensure an optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices, from desktops to smartphones.

### Brainstorming

1. **Authentication Screens**
- **Sign In**: Design the login interface where users enter their credentials.

2. **Dashboard**
- **Main Dashboard**: Design an overview screen that displays a summary of the user's financial status, including total income, expenses, and net earnings. Consider including quick access to add income/expenses and view detailed reports.

3. **Income Management**
- **Add Income**: A form to input new income entries, including details like amount, source/client, date, and any notes.
- **Income List/Overview**: Display a list of income transactions, possibly with options to edit, delete, or filter by date/client.

4. **Expense Management**
- **Add Expense**: A form for entering expenses, including amount, category (e.g., software, equipment), date, and notes.
- **Expense List/Overview**: A view to show all expenses, with functionality to edit, delete, or filter entries.

6. **Reports and Analytics**
- **Financial Reports**: Design screens that display financial reports and analytics, such as income vs. expenses, category-wise spending, and earnings by client or project.
- **Budget Tracking**: If including budget features, design screens for setting budgets, tracking progress, and viewing alerts for overages.

7. **Settings and Profile**
- **User Profile**: A screen for users to view and edit their profile information.
- **Settings**: Include options for configuring the application settings, such as notification preferences, account settings, and integration options.

8. **Navigation**
- **Navigation Menu/Sidebar**: Design a navigation system (e.g., a top bar or sidebar) that provides easy access to the various sections of the app like Dashboard, Income, Expenses, Projects, Reports, and Settings.

Additional Considerations
- **Responsive Design**: Consider designing wireframes for different screen sizes to ensure the application is usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Empty States and Loading**: Design screens or components to display when data is loading or when there are no entries (e.g., no expenses added yet).
- **Feedback and Alerts**: Consider how you will show success, error messages, or confirmations (e.g., after adding an income or deleting an expense).
